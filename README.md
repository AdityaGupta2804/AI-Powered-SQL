#Banking Data Query System
This project allows users to interact with a banking dataset by sending natural language queries. It processes these queries and generates SQL queries using the free Gemini API and then executes those queries against a database.

To run the Project :
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     python app.py

Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
Copy
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
2. Install Required Packages:
You need to install the following Python packages to run the project: 

Our Output:



Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
Torch: Deep learning framework (used by Gemini API)
Flask: Web framework for creating the API
Transformers: Hugging Face's library for transformer models (used for natural language processing)
Google-generativeai: It is the AI Model we are using as of now
You can install the dependencies by running:
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
If you don't have a requirements.txt, install the individual dependencies with: pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pandas torch flask transformers
3. Download Banking Dataset:
Database is already downloaded
Make sure the dataset is in the same directory as the project or adjust the paths in the code accordingly.
4. Run the Scripts:

6. Access the Frontend:
Once the Flask server is running, open the index.html file in your web browser. This frontend provides a basic form where you can input natural language queries, and it will output the corresponding SQL query.

To access it:

Open the index.html file in your browser.
Enter a natural language query.
The Flask API will process the input and display the generated SQL query.
How it Works
User Inputs Query: The user submits a query in natural language through the frontend form (HTML).
Flask API Receives Query: The query is sent to App.py, which acts as the backend server.
Query Processing:
n2sql.py uses the Gemini API (you’ll need an API key) to process the query and generate an SQL statement.
SQL Execution: The generated SQL query is executed on the banking.db SQLite database, and the results are sent back to the frontend.
Response Display: The frontend displays the SQL query generated by the backend.
Frontend (index.html)
The index.html provides a simple interface for interacting with the system. It consists of:

Text Box: Where users can input natural language queries.
Submit Button: Sends the query to the Flask API and receives the SQL query output.
Example:

Input: "How many people have subscribed to a term deposit?"
Output (SQL): SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE y = 'yes';
API Documentation
POST /query
Description: Accepts a natural language query and returns the corresponding SQL query.
Request:
Body:
json
Copy
{
  "query": "How many people have subscribed to a term deposit?"
}
Response:
Body:
json
Copy
{
  "sql_query": "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM transactions WHERE y = 'yes';"
}
Required Configurations for Gemini API:
Ensure you have an API key for Gemini (or whichever NLP model you're using) and configure it in n2sql.py to allow the translation of natural language into SQL.
Troubleshooting
Missing Packages: If you encounter errors related to missing Python packages, ensure that you have installed all dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

Gemini API Key: If the Gemini API doesn’t work, double-check that the API key is correctly configured in n2sql.py.

Database Errors: If you run into issues with database connection or query execution, ensure that the banking.db SQLite database is created successfully by load_data.py and contains the correct data.
